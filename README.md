This is a simple Python program I built to practice functions, loops, input validation, and working with lists.
The idea is pretty straightforward: you enter a bunch of player names, choose how many teams you want, and the program randomly splits everyone into teams.

It helped me get a better understanding of how to structure a program using multiple functions and how to handle user input safely.
